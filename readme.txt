Completed a challenge project from Codecademy's Full Stack Career Path. NOTE: I only worked on the script.js file. Everything else was in place beforehand (although I think I could have done most of this myself anyway!);

Instructions were as per below:

Challenge Project: Number Guesser
Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal, but you have an output section to help you test your functions and show you if you have syntax errors.
